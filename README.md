# Wordle-Clone

Wordle Clone app made with SwiftUI

It's really basic, an app that everyone knows, called Wordle.

Wordle is a daily word game created by Josh Wardle, a Brooklyn-based software engineer who has developed something of a reputation as a crafter of interesting social experiments. Every day, the people of the internet are greeted with a fresh word puzzle that can only be solved — or not! — using a series of process-of-elimination clues.

It works like this: When you open th eapp, you're greeted by 5-wide by 6-long grid of empty, white boxes. Each box can hold one letter, and so you guess at the answer by typing in a five-letter word and pressing 'Enter'.
There aren't any clues up front, so any five-letter word will do as an initial guess. That's where the game of Wordle really starts. When you send a guess along, the color of each letter's box changes.
If it turns green, that letter is in the daily word and you've placed it in the right spot.
If it turns yellow, the letter is in the word but you have it in the wrong position.
If the box turns grey, it means the letter isn't in the word at all.


I will implement dark mode and hard mode soon.

App contains 500+ English words right now and I'll add more language support.
